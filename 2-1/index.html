            I'm a high chool student who spends a lot of time at the screen. Most of my day is spent at school learning then when I get home I do my homework and study, during breaks I normally 
            play video games with my friends. Most of my programming knowledge comes from my career center program Computer Programming but I've also picked up a lot of knowledge on the field that
            I don't think is as easily obtained in a classroom.
